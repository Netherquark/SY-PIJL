# Array_and_ArrayList

This repository contains Java programs that demonstrate array and ArrayList operations, including:

1. **EvenOdd.java**:

   - Accepts integer input from the user.
   - Segregates numbers into two arrays: one for even numbers and one for odd numbers.
   - Displays both arrays.
2. **NeighborDifference.java**:

   - Contains a method `findMinDifferencePairIndex(int[] arr)` that finds two adjacent numbers in an array with the smallest absolute difference.
   - Returns the index of the first number in that pair.
   - Demonstrates the functionality with a sample array.
3. **ArrayListConversion.java**:

   - Demonstrates converting an array (using wrapper types) into an ArrayList.
   - Demonstrates converting an ArrayList into an array.
   - Uses examples with both Integer and String data types.
